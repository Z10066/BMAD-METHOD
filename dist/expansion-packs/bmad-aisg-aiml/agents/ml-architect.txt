# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-aisg-aiml/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-aisg-aiml/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-aisg-aiml/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-aisg-aiml/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-aisg-aiml/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-aisg-aiml/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - Save to file if possible
   - **IF elicit: true** ‚Üí MANDATORY 1-9 options format
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**‚ùå NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**‚úÖ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true

# Advanced ML/AI Design Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance ML system design content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of model architecture and data pipeline decisions through structured elicitation
- Support iterative refinement through multiple AI/ML engineering perspectives  
- Apply ML-specific critical thinking to architecture and implementation decisions

## Task Instructions

### 1. ML Design Context and Review

[[LLM: When invoked after outputting an ML design section:

1. First, provide a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented, with ML-specific focus (e.g., "Please review the model architecture for scalability and performance. Pay special attention to data pipeline efficiency and whether the chosen algorithms align with business objectives.")

2. If the section contains architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, or model diagrams, explain each briefly with ML context before offering elicitation options (e.g., "The MLOps pipeline diagram shows the flow from data ingestion through model training to deployment. Notice how monitoring feeds back into retraining triggers.")

3. If the section contains multiple ML components (like multiple models, pipelines, or evaluation metrics), inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:
   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual ML components within the section (specify which component when selecting an action)

4. Then present the action list as specified below.]]

### 2. Ask for Review and Present ML Design Action List

[[LLM: Ask the user to review the drafted ML design section. In the SAME message, inform them that they can suggest additions, removals, or modifications, OR they can select an action by number from the 'Advanced ML Design Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions'. If there are multiple ML components in the section, mention they can specify which component(s) to apply the action to. Then, present ONLY the numbered list (0-9) of these actions. Conclude by stating that selecting 9 will proceed to the next section. Await user selection. If an elicitation action (0-8) is chosen, execute it and then re-offer this combined review/elicitation choice. If option 9 is chosen, or if the user provides direct feedback, proceed accordingly.]]

**Present the numbered list (0-9) with this exact format:**

```text
**Advanced ML Design Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions**
Choose an action (0-9 - 9 to bypass - HELP for explanation of these options):

0. Expand or Contract for Production Requirements
1. Explain ML Design Reasoning (Step-by-Step)
2. Critique and Refine from Data Science Perspective
3. Analyze Pipeline Dependencies and Data Flow
4. Assess Alignment with Business KPIs
5. Identify ML-Specific Risks and Edge Cases
6. Challenge from Critical Engineering Perspective
7. Explore Alternative ML Approaches
8. Hindsight Postmortem: The 'If Only...' ML Reflection
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

### 3. Processing Guidelines

**Do NOT show:**
- The full protocol text with `[[LLM: ...]]` instructions
- Detailed explanations of each option unless executing or the user asks
- Any internal template markup

**After user selection from the list:**
- Execute the chosen action according to the ML design protocol instructions below
- Ask if they want to select another action or proceed with option 9 once complete
- Continue until user selects option 9 or indicates completion

## ML Design Action Definitions

0. **Expand or Contract for Production Requirements**
   [[LLM: Ask the user whether they want to 'expand' on the ML design content (add more technical detail, include edge cases, add monitoring metrics) or 'contract' it (simplify architecture, focus on MVP features, reduce complexity). Also, ask if there's a specific deployment environment or scale they have in mind (cloud, edge, batch vs real-time). Once clarified, perform the expansion or contraction from your current ML role's perspective, tailored to the specified production requirements if provided.]]

1. **Explain ML Design Reasoning (Step-by-Step)**
   [[LLM: Explain the step-by-step ML design thinking process that you used to arrive at the current proposal. Focus on algorithm selection rationale, data pipeline decisions, performance trade-offs, and how design decisions support business objectives and technical constraints.]]

2. **Critique and Refine from Data Science Perspective**
   [[LLM: From your current ML role's perspective, review your last output or the current section for potential data quality issues, model performance concerns, statistical validity problems, or areas for improvement. Consider experiment design, evaluation metrics, and bias concerns, then suggest a refined version that better serves ML best practices.]]

3. **Analyze Pipeline Dependencies and Data Flow**
   [[LLM: From your ML engineering standpoint, examine the content's structure for data pipeline dependencies, feature engineering steps, and model training/serving workflows. Confirm if components are properly sequenced and identify potential bottlenecks or failure points in the ML pipeline.]]

4. **Assess Alignment with Business KPIs**
   [[LLM: Evaluate how well the current ML design content contributes to the stated business objectives and KPIs. Consider whether the chosen metrics actually measure business value, whether the model performance thresholds are appropriate, and if the ROI justifies the complexity.]]

5. **Identify ML-Specific Risks and Edge Cases**
   [[LLM: Based on your ML expertise, brainstorm potential failure modes, data drift scenarios, model degradation risks, adversarial attacks, or edge cases that could affect the current design. Consider both technical risks (overfitting, data leakage) and business risks (bias, fairness, compliance).]]

6. **Challenge from Critical Engineering Perspective**
   [[LLM: Adopt a critical engineering perspective on the current content. If the user specifies another viewpoint (e.g., 'as a security expert', 'as a data engineer', 'as a business stakeholder'), critique from that perspective. Otherwise, play devil's advocate from your ML engineering expertise, arguing against the current design proposal and highlighting potential weaknesses, scalability issues, or maintenance challenges.]]

7. **Explore Alternative ML Approaches**
   [[LLM: From your ML role's perspective, first broadly brainstorm a range of diverse approaches to solving the same problem. Consider different algorithms, architectures, deployment strategies, or data approaches. Then, from this wider exploration, select and present 2-3 distinct alternative ML approaches, detailing the pros, cons, performance implications, and resource requirements for each.]]

8. **Hindsight Postmortem: The 'If Only...' ML Reflection**
   [[LLM: In your current ML persona, imagine this is a postmortem for a deployed model based on the current design content. What's the one 'if only we had considered/tested/monitored X...' that your role would highlight from an ML perspective? Include the imagined production failures, data issues, or business impacts. This should be both insightful and somewhat humorous, focusing on common ML pitfalls.]]

9. **Proceed / No Further Actions**
   [[LLM: Acknowledge the user's choice to finalize the current ML design work, accept the AI's last output as is, or move on to the next step without selecting another action from this list. Prepare to proceed accordingly.]]

## ML Engineering Context Integration

This elicitation task is specifically designed for ML/AI engineering and should be used in contexts where:

- **Model Architecture Design**: When defining model architectures and training strategies
- **MLOps Pipeline Planning**: When designing training, deployment, and monitoring pipelines
- **Data Engineering**: When planning data collection, processing, and feature engineering
- **Performance Optimization**: When balancing accuracy, latency, and resource constraints
- **Production Readiness**: When preparing models for deployment and scaling

The questions and perspectives offered should always consider:
- Data quality and availability
- Model performance vs complexity trade-offs
- Production deployment constraints
- Monitoring and maintenance requirements
- Regulatory and ethical considerations
- Cost and resource optimization
- Singapore-specific requirements (PDPA, IMDA guidelines)

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-core/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-aisg-aiml/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**
   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:
   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:
   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:
   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ‚úÖ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ‚ùå FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:
   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:
   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Document Sharding Task

## Purpose

- Split a large document into multiple smaller documents based on level 2 sections
- Create a folder structure to organize the sharded documents
- Maintain all content integrity including code blocks, diagrams, and markdown formatting

## Primary Method: Automatic with markdown-tree

[[LLM: First, check if markdownExploder is set to true in .bmad-aisg-aiml/core-config.yaml. If it is, attempt to run the command: `md-tree explode {input file} {output path}`.

If the command succeeds, inform the user that the document has been sharded successfully and STOP - do not proceed further.

If the command fails (especially with an error indicating the command is not found or not available), inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is enabled but the md-tree command is not available. Please either:

1. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
2. Or set markdownExploder to false in .bmad-core/core-config.yaml

**IMPORTANT: STOP HERE - do not proceed with manual sharding until one of the above actions is taken.**"

If markdownExploder is set to false, inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is currently false. For better performance and reliability, you should:

1. Set markdownExploder to true in .bmad-core/core-config.yaml
2. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`

I will now proceed with the manual sharding process."

Then proceed with the manual method below ONLY if markdownExploder is false.]]

### Installation and Usage

1. **Install globally**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser
   ```

2. **Use the explode command**:

   ```bash
   # For PRD
   md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd

   # For Architecture
   md-tree explode docs/architecture.md docs/architecture

   # For any document
   md-tree explode [source-document] [destination-folder]
   ```

3. **What it does**:
   - Automatically splits the document by level 2 sections
   - Creates properly named files
   - Adjusts heading levels appropriately
   - Handles all edge cases with code blocks and special markdown

If the user has @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser installed, use it and skip the manual process below.

---

## Manual Method (if @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser is not available or user indicated manual method)

### Task Instructions

1. Identify Document and Target Location

- Determine which document to shard (user-provided path)
- Create a new folder under `docs/` with the same name as the document (without extension)
- Example: `docs/prd.md` ‚Üí create folder `docs/prd/`

2. Parse and Extract Sections

CRITICAL AEGNT SHARDING RULES:

1. Read the entire document content
2. Identify all level 2 sections (## headings)
3. For each level 2 section:
   - Extract the section heading and ALL content until the next level 2 section
   - Include all subsections, code blocks, diagrams, lists, tables, etc.
   - Be extremely careful with:
     - Fenced code blocks (```) - ensure you capture the full block including closing backticks and account for potential misleading level 2's that are actually part of a fenced section example
     - Mermaid diagrams - preserve the complete diagram syntax
     - Nested markdown elements
     - Multi-line content that might contain ## inside code blocks

CRITICAL: Use proper parsing that understands markdown context. A ## inside a code block is NOT a section header.]]

### 3. Create Individual Files

For each extracted section:

1. **Generate filename**: Convert the section heading to lowercase-dash-case
   - Remove special characters
   - Replace spaces with dashes
   - Example: "## Tech Stack" ‚Üí `tech-stack.md`

2. **Adjust heading levels**:
   - The level 2 heading becomes level 1 (# instead of ##) in the sharded new document
   - All subsection levels decrease by 1:

   ```txt
     - ### ‚Üí ##
     - #### ‚Üí ###
     - ##### ‚Üí ####
     - etc.
   ```

3. **Write content**: Save the adjusted content to the new file

### 4. Create Index File

Create an `index.md` file in the sharded folder that:

1. Contains the original level 1 heading and any content before the first level 2 section
2. Lists all the sharded files with links:

```markdown
# Original Document Title

[Original introduction content if any]

## Sections

- [Section Name 1](./section-name-1.md)
- [Section Name 2](./section-name-2.md)
- [Section Name 3](./section-name-3.md)
  ...
```

### 5. Preserve Special Content

1. **Code blocks**: Must capture complete blocks including:

   ```language
   content
   ```

2. **Mermaid diagrams**: Preserve complete syntax:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
   ...
   ```

3. **Tables**: Maintain proper markdown table formatting

4. **Lists**: Preserve indentation and nesting

5. **Inline code**: Preserve backticks

6. **Links and references**: Keep all markdown links intact

7. **Template markup**: If documents contain {{placeholders}} ,preserve exactly

### 6. Validation

After sharding:

1. Verify all sections were extracted
2. Check that no content was lost
3. Ensure heading levels were properly adjusted
4. Confirm all files were created successfully

### 7. Report Results

Provide a summary:

```text
Document sharded successfully:
- Source: [original document path]
- Destination: docs/[folder-name]/
- Files created: [count]
- Sections:
  - section-name-1.md: "Section Title 1"
  - section-name-2.md: "Section Title 2"
  ...
```

## Important Notes

- Never modify the actual content, only adjust heading levels
- Preserve ALL formatting, including whitespace where significant
- Handle edge cases like sections with code blocks containing ## symbols
- Ensure the sharding is reversible (could reconstruct the original from shards)

        title: Existing Infrastructure or Framework
        instruction: |
          Before proceeding with AI/ML architecture design, check if the project is based on existing infrastructure:

          1. Review the BRD and technical docs for any mentions of:
          - Existing ML platforms (Databricks, SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML)
          - Current data infrastructure (data lakes, warehouses, streaming)
          - Model registries or experiment tracking systems
          - Feature stores or data catalogs
          - AISG program frameworks (100E, AIAP, SIP, LADP)

          2. If existing infrastructure is mentioned:
          - Ask the user to provide access or documentation
          - Analyze current capabilities and limitations
          - Identify integration points and constraints
          - Use this analysis to inform architecture decisions

          3. If this is a greenfield ML project:
          - Suggest appropriate ML platforms based on requirements
          - Explain build vs buy trade-offs
          - Let the user decide on infrastructure approach

          Document the decision here before proceeding with the architecture design. If none, just say N/A

          2. Provide your recommendation with clear rationale
          3. Get user confirmation before finalizing
          4. These patterns should align with MLOps best practices

          Common ML patterns to consider:
          - Training patterns (batch, online, continuous)
          - Serving patterns (REST API, streaming, batch prediction)
          - Feature engineering patterns (feature store, streaming features)

# AI/ML Architect Solution Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the ML Architect to validate the technical design and architecture before ML system implementation. The ML Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the ML architecture is robust, scalable, performant, and aligned with business requirements.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. ml-architecture.md - The primary ML architecture document (check docs/ml-architecture.md)
2. data-architecture.md - Data pipeline and storage architecture (check docs/data-architecture.md)
3. mlops-architecture.md - MLOps and deployment architecture (check docs/mlops-architecture.md)
4. Business requirements document for alignment validation
5. Performance requirements and SLAs
6. Platform and infrastructure specifications

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

ML PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the ML project type by checking:
- Is this a traditional ML, deep learning, or LLM/RAG project?
- What are the deployment targets (cloud, edge, mobile)?
- What are the performance requirements (latency, throughput)?
- Are there specific compliance requirements (PDPA, IMDA, MAS)?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:
1. Deep Analysis - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from the documents when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps, not just confirm what's present
4. Performance Focus - Consider inference latency, training time, and resource utilization for every architectural decision

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:
- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

# AI/ML Change Navigation Checklist

**Purpose:** To systematically guide the ML team through analysis and planning when a significant change (model drift, performance degradation, data quality issue, compliance requirement) is identified during ML system operation.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the user. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - ML CHANGE NAVIGATION

Changes in ML systems are inevitable - model drift, data distribution shifts, performance degradation, and new requirements are part of the ML lifecycle.

Before proceeding, understand:
1. This checklist is for SIGNIFICANT changes affecting model performance or system architecture
2. Minor hyperparameter tweaks don't require this process
3. The goal is to maintain system reliability while adapting to new realities
4. Business continuity and model performance are paramount

Required context:
- The triggering issue (drift metrics, performance alerts, compliance notice)
- Current system state (model version, recent deployments, performance metrics)
- Access to ML architecture docs, model cards, and monitoring dashboards
- Understanding of business SLAs and compliance requirements

APPROACH:
This is an interactive process. Discuss technical implications, business impact, and risk mitigation. The user makes final decisions, but provide expert ML/MLOps guidance.

REMEMBER: ML systems evolve continuously. Changes often lead to better models and more robust systems.]]

---

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

[[LLM: Start by understanding the ML-specific issue. Ask technical questions:
- What metrics triggered this? (accuracy drop, latency increase, drift score)
- Is this gradual degradation or sudden failure?
- Can we pinpoint when the issue started?
- What monitoring data do we have?
- Is this affecting all predictions or specific segments?

Focus on measurable impacts and data-driven evidence.]]

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Element:** Clearly identify the ML component/metric revealing the issue
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely
  - [ ] Model performance degradation (accuracy, F1, AUC)?
  - [ ] Data drift (feature drift, label drift, concept drift)?
  - [ ] System performance issue (latency, throughput)?
  - [ ] Compliance/regulatory requirement change?
  - [ ] Data quality degradation?
  - [ ] Security vulnerability or adversarial attack?
- [ ] **Assess Business Impact:** Document specific business metrics affected
- [ ] **Gather Technical Evidence:** Note monitoring data, drift scores, performance metrics, error logs

## 2. ML System Impact Assessment

[[LLM: ML systems have complex dependencies. Evaluate systematically:

- [ ] **Summarize System Impact:** Document effects on ML pipeline and dependent systems

## 3. ML Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

[[LLM: ML documentation drives reproducibility. Check each artifact:
1. Does this invalidate model assumptions?
2. Are performance benchmarks still valid?
3. Do SLAs need renegotiation?
4. Are compliance certifications affected?

Missing conflicts cause production issues later.]]

- [ ] **Review Model Documentation:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with model card assumptions?

  - [ ] Do audit trails need enhancement?
  - [ ] Is model explainability impacted?
- [ ] **Summarize Artifact Impact:** List all ML documents requiring updates

## 4. Path Forward Evaluation

[[LLM: Present ML-specific solutions with trade-offs:
1. What's the expected performance improvement?
2. How long will retraining/deployment take?
3. What's the business risk during transition?
