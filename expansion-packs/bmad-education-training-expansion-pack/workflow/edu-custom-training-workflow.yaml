  decision_guidance:
    - "Go Full vs Fast-Track based on customization complexity, compliance impact, and content gap size."
    - "Enforce accessibility and privacy gates before content production and LMS publication."
    - "If assessment integrity risks are high, require pre-moderation and proctoring setup before launch."
    - "Use data from early cohorts to trigger content hotfixes and intervention playbooks."

  handoff_prompts:
    - "What artifacts must be handed over? Where are they stored?"
    - "Who signs off? What are objective acceptance criteria?"
    - "What evidence is required for compliance and audits?"
    - "What is the rollback plan for release failures?"

  training_best_practices:
    - "Design around OBE; align assessments to outcomes and rubrics."
    - "Default to UDL and WCAG AA; include captions/transcripts and keyboard operability."
    - "Instrument xAPI/learning analytics from day one; define KPIs before delivery."
    - "Run short feedback loops (observations, quick surveys, moderation) and act quickly."

  success_criteria:
    - "≥ 90% of artifacts captured in evidence catalog and version-controlled."
    - "Accessibility and privacy validations passed before go-live."
    - "KPI targets met (completion, satisfaction, competency attainment)."
    - "CQI cycle closed with CAPA actions verified."
